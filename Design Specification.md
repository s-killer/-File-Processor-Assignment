# Design Specification: File Processor

## 1. Overview:
The File Processor is a Python-based utility designed to handle the processing of input files containing salary information and generate a CSV file with processed data. It provides a command-line interface for ease of use and integrates with Git for version control and collaboration.

## 2. Functional Requirements:
- **Input Processing:**
  - The utility shall read input files from a specified input folder.
  - It shall accept files with the ".dat" extension.
  - Each line of the input file shall be processed, extracting relevant data.
  - Graceful handling of errors, such as missing or invalid data, shall be implemented.
  
- **Data Processing:**
  - Necessary fields shall be extracted from each line, including ID, name, email, job title, basic salary, and allowances.
  - Gross salary shall be calculated by summing basic salary and allowances.
  - Salary data for each employee ID shall be aggregated.
  - The second-highest gross salary shall be identified, and the average gross salary across all records shall be calculated.

- **Output Generation:**
  - Processed data shall be written to a CSV file.
  - Headers for each field shall be included.
  - An empty row shall be added for better readability.
  - Entries for the second-highest gross salary and average gross salary shall be included.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance:**
  - The utility shall efficiently process large input files within a reasonable time frame.
  - Data structures and algorithms shall be optimized for faster processing.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Graceful handling of exceptions shall be implemented, providing informative error messages.
  - Errors and exceptions shall be logged for debugging and auditing purposes.
- **Usability:**
  - Clear progress messages shall be provided to indicate the status of file processing.
  - The command-line interface shall be intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Reliability:**
  - The utility shall be robust against unexpected input data formats or corrupted files.
  - Backup mechanisms shall be implemented to prevent data loss in case of system failures.
- **Scalability:**
  - The system shall be designed to handle a growing volume of input files and data without significant performance degradation.
  - Consideration shall be given to distributed processing or parallelization for scalability.

## 4. Technical Stack:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Modules:** `csv`, `os`, `collections`
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Development Environment:** Any compatible Python development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

## 5. Testing:
- **Unit Testing:** Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of data processing functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the integration of individual components to ensure seamless operation.
- **Regression Testing:** Perform regression testing to identify and fix any issues introduced during development or updates.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve end-users or stakeholders to validate the functionality and usability of the File Processor.

## 6. Deployment:
- **Installation:** Provide clear instructions for installing and configuring the File Processor.
- **Documentation:** Include comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage.
- **Support:** Offer ongoing support and maintenance to address any issues or inquiries from users.

## Conclusion:
The File Processor is a versatile utility that fulfills the requirements for processing input files containing salary information. With its robust functionality, clear documentation, and integration with Git, it provides a seamless experience for users and facilitates collaboration and version control.
